# Paper-Vs-Picture
A lightweight webapp that determines wether the book was better than the movie based on ratings from IMDB and Google Books.

Written in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This app utilizes 4 separate APIs to determine if the book or movie is better, and to populate the app with content such as movie and book covers. Amazon links to purchase content will be populated based on what title is searched. A map api will get user location and provide local book stores.


GitHub prevents the Amazon links being redirected away from Github IO pages. 
the here MAP API does not load while being hosted by Github.
